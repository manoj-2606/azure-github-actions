Here are some practical ways to keep your GitHub profile consistently active:
Small but meaningful contributions

Fix typos or improve documentation in your own or open-source repos — even a one-line README update counts as a commit
Add comments to your code explaining what things do
Refactor small pieces of code (rename variables, clean up functions)
Add .gitignore, LICENSE, or CONTRIBUTING.md files to existing projects

Build a habit around learning

Create a "Today I Learned" (TIL) repo where you push a small markdown note every day about something you learned
Keep a "coding journal" repo — just daily notes, ideas, or observations in markdown files
Solve one LeetCode/HackerRank problem daily and push your solution to a dedicated repo

Consistent mini-projects

Pick a small side project and break it into tiny daily tasks (update a config, add one feature, write one test)
Automate something small in your life with a script and push it
Build a personal website and keep tweaking it

Open source participation

Review issues on open source projects and leave comments (doesn't show on your graph, but builds reputation)
Submit small PRs — even documentation fixes count and are often welcomed

The realistic approach
Honestly, the most sustainable method is the TIL repo combined with one small daily task on a side project. 
It takes 10–15 minutes, the commits are genuine, and over time you actually accumulate useful notes and projects.
One thing worth keeping in mind — GitHub's contribution graph counts commits to the default branch (or any branch if you set it that way in settings), 
so make sure you're pushing to the right branch. And avoid just making empty commits to game the graph; it's obvious to anyone who looks and doesn't help your actual skills.
