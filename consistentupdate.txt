Here are some practical ways to keep your GitHub profile consistently active:
Small but meaningful contributions

Fix typos or improve documentation in your own or open-source repos — even a one-line README update counts as a commit
Add comments to your code explaining what things do
Refactor small pieces of code (rename variables, clean up functions)
Add .gitignore, LICENSE, or CONTRIBUTING.md files to existing projects

Build a habit around learning

Create a "Today I Learned" (TIL) repo where you push a small markdown note every day about something you learned
Keep a "coding journal" repo — just daily notes, ideas, or observations in markdown files
Solve one LeetCode/HackerRank problem daily and push your solution to a dedicated repo

Consistent mini-projects

Pick a small side project and break it into tiny daily tasks (update a config, add one feature, write one test)
Automate something small in your life with a script and push it
Build a personal website and keep tweaking it

Open source participation

Review issues on open source projects and leave comments (doesn't show on your graph, but builds reputation)
Submit small PRs — even documentation fixes count and are often welcomed
