Objective — What You’re Actually Building

You are building:

A controlled Infrastructure delivery pipeline

Where:

Engineer → PR → Plan → Review → Approval → Apply → Audit

No direct apply.
No cowboy pushes.
No accidental production destruction.

Real-World Purpose

In real companies:

Terraform runs from pipelines

State is remote (never local)

PR validation prevents outages

Manual approval protects production

Audit trail proves compliance

If you can explain and implement this, you are employable.
