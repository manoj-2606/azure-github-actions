   DAY 10 — GOALS, OBJECTIVE & PURPOSE
   azure-secure-foundation-iac
================================================================

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IS THE OBJECTIVE OF DAY 10?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 10 is not about learning a new feature.
It is about proving you can BUILD something that a company
would actually trust in production.

The objective is to consolidate everything from Days 1–9
into ONE coherent, professional, production-grade project
that you can present to any hiring team.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IS THE GOAL?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

To build a portfolio project that demonstrates:

  ✅ Multi-environment design (dev / stage / prod)
      → You understand that infra is not one-size-fits-all
      → Different environments = different state, different settings

  ✅ Remote backend with separate state per environment
      → You understand why local state is dangerous
      → Each env has isolated state: dev/ stage/ prod/ keys
      → State is locked and stored securely in Azure Blob

  ✅ Reusable Terraform modules
      → You didn't copy-paste code across 3 environments
      → Modules for networking, storage, keyvault, monitoring
      → One change in a module propagates to all envs

  ✅ Dynamic logic with for_each and dynamic blocks
      → NSG rules are not hardcoded
      → Subnets are defined as maps, rules as lists
      → This makes the code scalable and readable

  ✅ CI/CD via Azure DevOps pipeline
      → Plan runs automatically on every PR
      → Apply only runs when merged to main
      → Prod requires manual approval before apply

  ✅ OIDC Authentication
      → No client secrets anywhere
      → No credentials stored in pipeline variables
      → Azure DevOps authenticates using federated identity tokens

  ✅ Key Vault integration
      → Secrets are stored in Key Vault, not in .tf files
      → sensitive = true on all secret outputs
      → purge_protection = true in prod

  ✅ lifecycle prevent_destroy on critical resources
      → Prod RG, Key Vault, and Storage Account cannot be
         accidentally destroyed by terraform destroy
      → You must explicitly remove the block to destroy

  ✅ Drift detection
      → A scheduled pipeline runs terraform plan daily in prod
      → If infra was changed manually, the pipeline alerts you
      → This is how real teams catch "ClickOps" changes

  ✅ Documentation (README)
      → Architecture explained
      → State design explained
      → Pipeline flow explained
      → Security decisions explained
      → Why OIDC explained

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHAT IS THE PURPOSE?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

The purpose is your transformation from:
  "I did some Terraform exercises"
  →  to →
  "I can design, build, and automate cloud infrastructure."

This project becomes your PORTFOLIO ANCHOR.
When you apply for Cloud / DevOps / Infrastructure roles,
this is what you show instead of just listing Terraform on your CV.

You can say:
  "I built a production-grade IaC project with multi-environment
   design, OIDC-secured CI/CD, Key Vault integration, lifecycle
   protection, and automated drift detection."

That sentence alone puts you above 80% of junior applicants.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHY DOES THIS MATTER IN THE REAL WORLD?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

REMOTE BACKEND
→ Real companies NEVER store state locally.
  If your laptop is stolen or crashes, state is gone.
  Remote state in Azure Blob = safe, shared, locked.

MODULES
→ Large infra teams manage 50+ environments.
  Without modules, every change is copy-paste hell.
  With modules, fix it once, fix it everywhere.

OIDC (No Secrets)
→ Leaked service principal secrets have caused real data breaches.
  OIDC eliminates the secret entirely.
  This is the modern, correct way to authenticate pipelines.

PREVENT_DESTROY
→ Developers have accidentally destroyed production databases
  and storage accounts. It happens more than you think.
  prevent_destroy is your last line of defense.

DRIFT DETECTION
→ In real companies, someone ALWAYS clicks around in the portal.
  They call it "quick fix". You call it "drift."
  Drift means your state no longer reflects reality.
  Automated drift detection catches this before it causes outages.

CI/CD (Plan on PR, Apply on main)
→ Manual terraform apply from someone's laptop is dangerous.
  CI/CD ensures every change is reviewed (plan) before it happens.
  Approval gates on prod means no one can deploy without sign-off.

KEY VAULT
→ Storing secrets in code or in plain text is how breaches happen.
  Key Vault is the Azure-native way to manage secrets.
  Marking outputs as sensitive = true prevents them appearing in logs.

LOG ANALYTICS (Prod Only)
→ Real production infra must be observable.
  If something breaks, you need logs.
  Dev doesn't need 90-day log retention — prod does.

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
WHERE ARE YOU AFTER DAY 10?
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

You are approximately 60–65% of a junior cloud infrastructure engineer.

Skills you now have:
  → Terraform core (providers, resources, variables, outputs, locals)
  → Remote state management
  → Module design
  → Dynamic and conditional logic
  → Lifecycle management
  → CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
  → OIDC authentication
  → Key Vault integration
  → Drift detection

Your next 30–45 day arc to become competitive:
  → Azure networking deep dive (VNet peering, private endpoints, DNS)
  → AKS with Terraform (Kubernetes infrastructure)
  → Monitoring & alerting (Azure Monitor, Alerts)
  → Cost management (budgets, cost analysis)
  → Azure Policy + Terraform
  → Terratest basics (automated infrastructure testing)
  → Multi-region design

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE SINGLE SENTENCE THAT SUMMARIZES DAY 10
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

Day 10 is the day you stop being someone who learned Terraform
and start being someone who can be trusted with infrastructure.
