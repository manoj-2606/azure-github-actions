Objective

Move Terraform state from:

your laptop

to:

Azure Storage (single source of truth)

with locking (no concurrent corruption)

with separate environments (dev/stage/prod isolation)

Goal

Multiple engineers can:

plan safely

apply safely

never corrupt state

never destroy wrong environment

Real-world use

Without this:

duplicate infra

state drift

random deletes

2AM outages

you get fired

With this:

safe team workflows

reproducible infra

production-grade Terraform

If you can’t explain what state is and where it lives, you’re guessing. Engineers don’t guess.
