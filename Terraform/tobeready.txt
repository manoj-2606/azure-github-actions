Now — your bigger question
“How many days to be Finland-ready?”

Let’s be direct.

Right now you’re at:

~25% of real Terraform skill

You know mechanics, not production usage yet.

To be hireable internationally (Finland-level or any serious market), you need:

Phase 1 — Foundations (done/doing)

Day 1–5 (current)

Phase 2 — Professional Terraform (7–10 days more)

modules advanced patterns

workspaces vs folder strategy

remote backend properly

dynamic blocks

lifecycle rules

importing existing infra

state manipulation

CI/CD with pipelines

linting + formatting

secrets handling

Phase 3 — Real-world project (10–14 days)

Build ONE serious project:

Example:

full VNet architecture

NSGs

VM/AKS

monitoring

backend

pipelines

multi-env

Portfolio-grade.

This is what recruiters care about.

Straight answer

If you work seriously:

2–3 hours daily

hands-on only

You need:

~25–30 total focused days

Not months.

But only if you avoid:

YouTube binge

tutorial hopping

theory addiction

Build or nothing.
