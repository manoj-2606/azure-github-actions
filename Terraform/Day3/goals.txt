First — Understand the objective (no sugarcoating)

If you miss this, the rest is pointless.

What you’re actually learning

Not Terraform syntax.

You’re learning:

separation of responsibility

boundaries

reusability

contracts between components

maintainable infra

This is software engineering, not “infra scripting”.

If you keep everything in main.tf, you’re basically writing:

a 1,000-line bash script

That’s junior behavior.

Real-world reason (why this matters)

In companies:

You will NOT build:

1 storage account

1 vnet

You will build:

30 environments

20 storage accounts

10 VNets

5 teams reusing same patterns

Without modules you get:

copy paste

drift

bugs

inconsistent naming

nightmare maintenance

Modules = reusable Lego blocks.

One fix → affects everything.

That’s the difference between:

hobbyist Terraform
vs

production Terraform
